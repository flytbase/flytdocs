Basics

Directory Structure
-------------------

The repository is divided into 3 directories depending upon the host OS you choose to use. *Linux* is further divided into 2 depending upon the GPU driver running on your machine.
 
Eventually, all the directories have the following scripts:
 
**setup** : This script as the name suggests sets up your machine to run FlytSim.

**start** : This script launches a FlytSim docker container for you. It also opens up a tab in your browser connecting to http://localhost/flytconsole. Try waiting for around 30 seconds after triggering this script, before manually opening up the link to FlytConsole. You can use this script to restart FlytSim session as well.
 
**stop** : As its clear from the name, it stops the FlytSim app and shuts down the docker container, but preserving its environment, which means executing the *start* script again, would start FlytSim app and resume the container session for you.
 
**openshell** : This script would launch a bash shell inside the FlytSim container. You can execute this script in parallel, to launch multiple shells inside the FlytSim container.
 
**reset** : This script resets FlytSim container to factory default settings.
 
**docker-compose.yml** : This is a yml specification of the docker container. **Please refrain from editing this file, unless you are an expert on Docker.**
