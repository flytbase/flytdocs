Execute built-in Demo Apps
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

FlytOS comes with pre-installed Demo apps which can be executed to do simple navigation tasks. 
All the sample applications can be found on our `github repository <https://github.com/flytbase/flytsamples>`_.

Demo App 1
----------

This demo app makes the drone takeoff, move in a square trajectory of side length 5m and land once the entire mission is over. 

Below is a demo `youtube video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwKZXkzkM80>`_ of the same app when run on :ref:`FlytPOD <about_flytpod_pro>`.

Demo App 2
----------

.. note:: This demo requires arguments to be passed.


This demo app makes the drone takeoff, move in a square trajectory of side length *provided as an argument to the script* and land once the entire mission is over.

Create and Compile custom app
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


* Create a directory where you want to keep the source files of your onboard apps::
  
  $ mkdir onboard_apps 
* Create a directory inside *onboard_apps* for your first app::
  
  $ mkdir my_first_cpp_app
* Create your own my_first_cpp_app.cpp file. You can use the following snippet to start building your app.
  
  .. code-block:: c
    
        #include <cpp_api/navigation_bridge.h>

        Navigation nav;
        int main(int argc, char *argv[])
        {
            nav.takeoff(3.0);   //OR nav.arm();
            /* Write your own logic below */
        }
  

* Copy CMakeLists.txt from the downloaded DemoApp1, and paste it inside my_first_cpp_app. This is the CMakeLists.txt file of DemoApp1. To find how to configure this file for my_first_cpp_app, go to :ref:`CMakeLists.txt - Explained<cmakelists_explained>`.

  .. literalinclude:: include/CMakeLists.txt
     :language: cmake
     :tab-width: 2

* Create a build directory to host all your build files::

  $ mkdir build
  $ cd build 

* Inside build directory, run the cmake command::
  
  $ cmake ..

* To build your cpp file, run the make command::
  
  $ make
  


.. _cmakelists_explained:

CMakeLists.txt - Explained
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Enter your project name - my_first_cpp_app

  .. code-block:: CMake

      cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8.3)
      project(my_first_cpp_app)

      SET(CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX /usr/local/flytos/userapps CACHE PATH "Cmake install prefix path for flytapps" FORCE)

      add_definitions(-std=c++11)

* Make Navigation FlytAPI Library - *cpp_api* and other dependencies available for your my_first_cpp_app.cpp.

  .. code-block:: CMake

      cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8.3)
      find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS cpp_api)
      find_package(Boost REQUIRED COMPONENTS system python)
      find_package(PythonLibs 2.7 REQUIRED)
      include_directories(${catkin_INCLUDE_DIRS} ${PYTHON_INCLUDE_DIRS})


* Give a suitable name (for example my_first_cpp_app) to your executable file and link it with libraries.

  .. literalinclude:: include/CMakeLists.txt
     :language: cmake
     :tab-width: 2
     :lines: 14-15

* Add the following install command to install your created my_first_cpp_app executable target to install space - /flyt/userapps/onboard_user/install. This would allow web/mobile apps to execute your installed scripts remotely. Visit |exec_script_link| for details about the corresponding API call.

Execute custom app
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* After compiling your my_first_cpp_app project, your executable my_first_cpp_app will be created inside build directory.
* If FlytOS/FlytSim is not launched, launch :ref:`FlytOS <start_stop_flytos>` or :ref:`FlytSim <launch flytsim>`.
* Execute your my_first_cpp_app cpp executable from terminal. 


Install custom app
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


To install your app into /flyt/userapps/onboard_user/install space, so that your Android/Web App could execute it remotely, run this command in your terminal::

  $ sudo make install
