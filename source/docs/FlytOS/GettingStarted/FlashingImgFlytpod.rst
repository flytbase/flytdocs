1. |my_flytbase_link| to your FlytBase Account.
2. Download the hardware specific |flytos_dl_link| from your FlytBase account.
3. Download size of the image is about 2.5 GBs.
4. Check *MD5 Hash* to verify the integrity of downloaded file. Since it is a large file, the commands may take a few minutes to complete:

   * **Linux**- launch a terminal and execute the following command

     .. code-block:: bash

         $ md5sum <path-to-downloaded-image>/flyt*.img.gz

   * **Windows**- launch a command window and execute the following command

     .. code-block:: bash

         $ CertUtil -hashfile <path-to-downloaded-image>/flyt*.img.gz MD5

   * **Mac OS**- launch a terminal and execute the following command

     .. code-block:: bash

         $ md5 <path-to-downloaded-image>/flyt*.img.gz

5. Compare the MD5 Hash generated to *MD5 Hash* mentioned in the |flytos_dl_link| download page.
.. 6. Uncompress/extract the downloaded image:

..    * **Linux**- launch a terminal and execute the following command

..      .. code-block:: bash

..          gunzip <path-to-downloaded-image>/flyt*.img.gz

..    * **Windows**- download and install 7-zip from `here <http://www.7-zip.org/download.html>`_. Extract downloaded image using 7-zip.
..    * **Mac OS**- launch a terminal and execute the following command

..      .. code-block:: bash

..          gunzip <path-to-downloaded-image>/flyt*.img.gz

.. 7. Uncompressed size of image is about 11.5GBs.

Image write to SD/eMMC Card
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. 1. We recommend using a 32 GB SD Card, but a 16 GB card would work fine too.
.. 2. Format the micro SD Card.
.. 3. Follow `this <http://odroid.com/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=en:odroid_flashing_tools>`_ guide to install the image on ODROID-XU4â€™s SD/eMMC card.


.. **Expanding SD Card partition:**

.. Since the image is only around 8.5 GBs, the rest of the SD Card would have unallocated memory. Follow `this guide <http://elinux.org/RPi_Resize_Flash_Partitions>`_ to expand the partition to the maximum possible size to utilize all memory.

.. We have created a video tutorial for Linux and Mac OS users, to help flash FlytOS Linux Image on their SD/eMMC cards and then expand the partition. Windows users can refer `this guide <http://odroid.com/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=en:odroid_flashing_tools>`_ for writing image and Windows Disk Management Utility to expand the SD/eMMC card.

We recommend using |etcher_link| for burning images to SD/eMMC cards.
To burn an image to your SD/eMMC card:

1. Download Etcher for your Operating System (OS X, Linux, Windows).

2. On opening you will be greeted with the following screen.

    .. image:: /_static/Images/etcher_tut_1.png

.. 3. Select your downloaded **uncompressed** image.

3. Select your downloaded image.
 
4. Choose the bootable drive (SD/eMMC Card) to burn the image onto (Please note that Etcher detects pendrives as bootable disks so proceed with caution).

    .. image:: /_static/Images/etcher_tut_2.png

5. Click on **Flash**.

    .. image:: /_static/Images/etcher_tut_3.png

Etcher will burn the image onto the SD/eMMC card and verify the image. Remove the SD card after you get the prompt.


.. warning:: The image is around 11.5 GB in size, thus the rest of the SD Card would have unallocated space. As this limits the available user area it is advised to extend your partition.


To extend your partition to cover your full SD card:

* Run the following command from terminal
  
  .. code-block:: bash

      $ sudo resize_flytimage

* On successful execution you will get the following output

  .. code-block:: bash

      Ok, Partition resized, please reboot now
      Once the reboot is completed please run this script again

* At this point please run the following to reboot your system

  .. code-block:: bash

      $ sudo reboot

* On successful reboot please run the command again

  .. code-block:: bash

      $ sudo resize_flytimage

* Your partition has been extended to cover your full SD Card and is now ready to use.
