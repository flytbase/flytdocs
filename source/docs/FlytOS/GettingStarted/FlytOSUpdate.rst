FlytOS Updates
==============

Automatic OTA
-------------

.. caution:: You must activate your device, without which auto-updates will not work.

* Apart from the option of manually downloading and installing the latest FlytOS debian, FlytOS has a built in auto-update functionality. 
* Whenever a flight computer with FlytOS installed on it has internet access at boot, it checks for possible updates and downloads them.
* Once the download is complete, the updates are installed upon the next reboot of your device.
* Reboot your device once the download is complete. Installation of the update would be triggered automatically.
* Please wait for a few minutes before trying to connect to FlytOS.
* In case of FlytPOD/PRO, during automatic installation, the USER-LED-1 starts blinking rapidly in red indicating that the FlytOS is being installed. You can also check the startup log for updates/installation related debug messages.



Configure Updates
-----------------

The auto-update process is configurable as per user needs. This section explains the different configuration options available and possible debugging methods.


* To configure updates launch FlytConsole and click on Update manager on the top right corner of FlytConsole.

* **Current FlytOS version** displays the currently installed FlytOS version. 
* **Available FlytOS version** displays the latest FlytOS update available in our server.   
* You can disable or enable auto-updates anytime using the **Auto Updates** checkbox. If Auto Update field is checked and a new update is available, it will get downloaded in the background, if the device has internet connection.
* You can also monitor the progress of update being downloaded from the **Update Download progress** field.

* In case there is some version of FlytOS that does not install correctly, or you want to skip that update completely, you can blacklist that version by entering it in the **Blacklist FlytOS version** field. FlytOS will no longer try to update to the Blacklisted FlytOS version. When another higher version is available to download, FlytOS will automatically download and install that version.

Startup Log
-----------

* The Startup log located at ``/flyt/logs/startup/flyt_startup.log`` contains a log of important startup events including any errors in updates or installation.
* **For debugging:** In case the updates are not installed successfully or you are unable to open FlytConsole, you can check the startup log to locate the error. You can view the log in a terminal using the following command:

.. code-block:: bash
   
   $ cat /flyt/logs/startup/flyt_startup.log
  

.. note:: For more help regarding auto updates, please post your queries in the `FlytBase forum <http://forums.flytbase.com/>`_ with the the startup log attached.
