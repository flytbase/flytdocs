Welcome to FlytDocs
====================


FlytBase is the next generation platform for commercial drone applications. It is by design open for developers to build advanced drone applications using its open APIs. FlytBase offers FlytOS which is a software framework for drones along with FlytSIM, the simulation environment and FlytSDKs, the web and mobile app development kits. Currently supported autopilot stacks include PX4 and APM. Supported companion computers include Raspberry Pi3, NVIDIA TX1, Intel Edison, Intel Aero, ODROID-XU4 and FlytPOD/PRO.

**FlytOS** is based on Linux and ROS (Robot Operating System) making it an ideal platform for research and commercial drone applications. It can interact with any compatible drone/autopilot using its adapter layer and exposes high level FlytAPIs in ROS, CPP, Python, REST and Websocket. It makes it easy to integrate custom payload and also provides advanced APIs using its onboard modules. These rich set of APIs allow for easy development of onboard business logic as well as remote monitoring and control through web and mobile apps. The modular design of FlytOS allows for integration with external ROS/Linux libraries and custom data plumbing between onboard and offboard apps. The vision of FlytOS is to provide a standard language for the drone developers to talk to their drones.

**FlytSIM** offers a SITL(Software In The Loop) simulation environment for testing user apps without the drone hardware. Applications developed using FlytAPIs can be tested in FlytSim, before deploying on actual drones. This offers developers a pleasant drone application development experience, while keeping it safe, and saving them huge amount of time and effort.

**FlytSDKs** are web and mobile app development kits to give you a headstart in building your apps using FlytAPIs. FlytSDKs simplify development by providing pre-integrated client libraries, mechanism to connect to the drone and a complete sample project with REST and WebSocket calls. 

**FlytPOD/PRO** is an integrated flight computer stack with a hybrid architecture, consisting of a STM32 microcontroller based autopilot tightly coupled with ODROID-XU4 SBC (single board computer). It also has a powerful WiFi router running OpenWRT firmware and several interfaces for custom payloads, radio receivers and special sensors. It comes with PX4 flight stack and FlytOS preloaded for an out-of-the-box ready-to-fly experience.

**FlytBase Cloud** is industryâ€™s first Drone-API As A Service. It provides APIs for real-time secure access to drone navigation, payload and telemetry over 4G/LTE. It also provides easy integration with variety of 3rd party apps to help developers create custom workflows to suit different business needs. 

This documentation gives all the inputs to get you started with FlytBase. You can learn about FlytOS and get a detailed reference for all the |api_link|. It provides a step by step guide to install and get started with drone application development. You can refer to the sample apps and start building your own onboard and web/mobile apps.
